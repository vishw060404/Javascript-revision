# JavaScript Mastery Roadmap — Progress Tracker ✅  

> **How to use this file**
- Treat this like a **self-audit document**
- ✅ Check a box **only when you can explain the concept without notes**
- If you can **predict output + explain why**, you’ve mastered it
- If not → leave it unchecked (no ego here)

---

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Asynchronous JavaScript
- [ ] I understand the **Event Loop**
- [ ] I know what Web APIs are
- [ ] I understand task queue vs microtask queue
- [ ] I know why `setTimeout(fn, 0)` is not instant
- [ ] I can explain async execution order

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Promises & Async/Await
- [ ] I understand promise states
- [ ] I can chain `.then()`
- [ ] I understand error handling in promises
- [ ] I can use `async/await` confidently
- [ ] I know how async code resumes execution

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ DOM & Events
- [ ] I understand the DOM as a tree
